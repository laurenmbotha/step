        <p> Hi there! My name is Lauren-Megan Botha and I am a rising sophomore at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science with a minor in Quantitative Social Analysis.
            I entered UChicago planning on double majoring in Public Policy and Computer Science, however upon exploring more of my interests I found I was passionate about learning Italian. 
            To compromise my interest in Public Policy and allow more space for studying Italian and studying abroad I decided to minor in Quantitative Social Analysis.
            Beyond Academics, I love music, exploring new places, and getting involved in advocacy on my campus </p>
       <p> I grew up in Austin, Texas in a very big family. 
           My parents are both from South Africa and immigrated with my oldest sister and brother to the United States settling in Austin. 
           Growing up in two different cultural contexts definitely shaped the way I see the world. 
           One of the best parts of South African culture is the food! It is absolutely phenomenal! My favorite dish is definitely Lamb Curry. </p>

        <h3> College Plus </h3>
        <p> College Plus is a website I developed with two peers at a Google program called CSSI last summer. 
            College Plus is a  website to help students navigate the college application process.

        <h3> Legal Hold Pro Script </h3>

        <p> My family, though we didn’t have much growing up, always put an emphasis on traveling.
        When I was younger my Dad and I would take camping trips across the country. 
        When I entered high school I was able to travel internationally to see more of the world! 
        I was a part of my school's Global studies program which allowed me to visit Costa Rica and Thailand. 
        It also allowed me to study abroad in Italy for a month in a small town called Ferrara. 
        Above you can see some of my favorite photos I took from my trips. I took the photo of Thailand and Italy, however not the one of Costa Rica.
        The photo of Thailand was taken on a rice farm in Chiang Mai I stayed at with my classmates. 
        The photo of Italy is a photo I took in St. Marino, one of my favorite cities in Italy. It is built into a mountain with different checkpoints on nearby mountain tops. 
        It is actually in itself a country, and is one of the world’s oldest surviving republics! The picture of Costa Rica is a picture from San Jose. In Costa Rica I was able to meet an indigenous tribe called the Bri Bri and learn about their struggle to keep their culture alive. 
        One place I would love to visit is South Africa so I can meet my family! </p>
